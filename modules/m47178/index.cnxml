Livelihood is a set of activities using own and common endowments (human and material), to generate adequate resources  (cash and non-cash), for meeting the requirements of self and the household, usually carried out repeatedly and as such becomes a way of life. Ideally, a livelihood should keep a household meaningfully occupied in a sustainable manner and with dignity. 
</para><para id="eip-787">Livelihood interventions are conscious efforts by a household, community or other agencies to promote and support livelihood opportunities for a large number of people (other than those directly or indirectly employed by them). Government of India has been one of the largest agencies involved in such livelihood promotion efforts.  However, the cooperative sector, the corporate sector as also the NGO sector has also contributed to promoting livelihoods. The basic process of designing a livelihood intervention involves three fold activities: (i) observing and understanding the local economy (getting to know the people, assessing factor conditions, understanding local demand condition); (ii) selecting livelihood activities suitable for the poor in the area; and (iii) deciding on intervention.</para></section><section id="eip-261"><title>Course Objectives </title><para id="eip-350">
The course provides a holistic and interdisciplinary exposure to the understanding of concepts, processes, and relationships between available endowments, production systems, and livelihoods of rural people. The course has three modules with five sessions each. Its first module provides livelihood perspectives to the participants; discusses life support systems and sustainable livelihoods linkages, processes, tools and techniques for designing livelihood interventions; and measurement of sustainable livelihoods. The second module deals with the major agro-climatic region-wise associated production systems and land and water-based livelihood options. It also deals with the gaps and potential of agriculture, livestock, and allied agricultural activities in various agro-climatic zones. Non-farm and forest-based livelihoods are discussed separately. In the third module, the course deals with the critical understanding of livelihood promotion approaches that have been adopted by the major development organisations in India.
